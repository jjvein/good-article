Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications— functionality that would normally require a native application—are coming to the web. Service workers provide the technical foundation that all these features will rely on.

丰富的线下体验，周期性的后台同步，推送消息-这些功能通常都只有在native 程序中见到，现在在web端也能够实现了。

Service Worker 为这些功能特性提供了实现的基础。
