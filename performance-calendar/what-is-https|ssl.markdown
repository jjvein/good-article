##[What is HTTPS/SSL & Will It Boost My Rankings?](https://www.hallaminternet.com/google-https-ssl-ranking-factor/)

Google announced late last week that they are starting to use HTTPS/SSL as a “lightweight” ranking signal within their Google search algorithm.  Google stated that this factor would only impact “fewer than 1% of global search queries.”  However, they did say that they may decide to strengthen the HTTPS ranking signal over time, presumably after giving webmasters the opportunity to switch their websites over to HTTPS. As I will go on to explain, moving to HTTPS (buying and installing an SSL certificate) should not be your number 1 priority right now, nor will it miraculously boost your website to the top of the search engine rankings, however it is certainly something to bear in mind over the coming months as Google continues it’s push towards improved online security.

Google 上周（2014-12-01）宣布使用HTTPS/SSL作为谷歌搜索算法的评级因素。他们表示这个因素将会有“少于1%的全局搜索权重比”.他们也在考虑要加强HTTPS的等级，当然会给网络管理员一定的时间将网址迁移到HTTPS上。 

下面我要强调的是：迁移到HTTPS（购买和安装SSL证书）并不一定是你首要最优先需要做的事情，也不是说迁移到HTTPS就能立刻让网页搜索排名提升，而是说我们需要继续关注Google对于未来网页安全方面的推动举措。

###What is HTTPS/SSL?

HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure, which is the secure version of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http).  HTTPS is usually used on sites to secure e-commerce transactions, such as online banking sites, email applications and e-commerce checkout areas.  When a user connects to a website via HTTPS, the website encrypts the session with a Digital SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Certificate.  A user can tell if they are connected to website that has a valid SSL certificate if the website URL begins with https:// instead of http://.  SSL certificates are essentially small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic  key to the domain of the website in question – once this certificate is installed, a secure connection is enabled between the web server (where the website is hosted) and the browser (where the website is being accessed) to stop anyone snooping in on the connection and seeing the data being transferred. Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox always display a padlock icon to indicate that a website is secured in this manner, whilst they also display https:// in the address bar. https SSL certificates have been used by as much as ten percent of all websites as standard up until Google’s announcement,  however I suspect that this announcement is likely to significantly increase the number of websites moving to HTTPS.

HTTPS代表了安全的“超文本传输协议”，是http的安全版本。HTTPS通常被用来
确保交易安全，比如银行网站，邮件系统，商业账单领域。当用户通过HTTPS链接到一个网站，网站会使用数字到SSL证书将用户的Session加密。用户可以通过在网站URL栏目里通过https://而不是http://知道自己访问的网站是不是有一个有效的SSL证书。SSL证书是一个非常小的数据文件并且绑定了一个网站有关的加密的key。一旦这个证书被安装在服务器上，在服务器和浏览器之间就建立了一个安全的链接。这个链接拒绝在在链接时被其他的动作打扰。Google 和 Firefox 在网页安全的情况下会在地址栏里展示一个绿色的小锁图标表示网站是安全的，同时也包括https://。在谷歌宣布这个消息的时候，大约有10%的网站已经使用SSl 证书，并且这个消息将会让更多的用户选择HTTPS。

###Should I be using HTTPS?

As I’ve already mentioned, running your website via HTTPS is not going to propel you to top of the search results for your target keywords – there are literally hundreds of other things you could be doing to improve your website which will yield better results in terms of rankings.  That being said, I do expect HTTPS to grow in importance over the coming years, which means that website owners need to prepare for the inevitable mass shift to HTTPS in good time by planning the migration well in advance. It is not too often Google publicly announce the factors they use to rank websites, however Google webmaster trends analysts Zineb Ait Bahajji and Gary Illyes have explicitly stated that Google “would like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.”  I’d therefore suggest that webmasters should take this as an advanced warning of the need to ensure their websites are only accessible via HTTPS in the not too distant future.

我之前已经提过，网站迁移到HTTPS并不能让你在搜索关键词上的排名到最前面－你可以做更多其他的让你的网站产出更好的排名。也就是说，我个人认为HTTPS在未来将会更加重要，网站拥有者必须做好准备在适当的时间将网址全部迁移到HTTPS。Google通过这种公共方式的宣布HTTPS会影响网址排名是很不常见的。Google网站趋势分析员Zineb Ait Bahajji 和 Gary Illyes 明确的表示，Google将会鼓励所有的网站从HTTP迁移到HTTPS来确保网站的安全。
我也因此建议网站管理员需要接受这个提前的警示，可能在不久的将来，我们的网站只能通过HTTPS才能访问到。 

###How to migrate to HTTPS

Google stated in their announcement last week that they have seen a lot more webmasters adopting HTTPS, and that they have already been testing it as a ranking signal with “positive” results.  If your entire site is already running on HTTPS, you shouldn’t need to worry, but you’re being encouraged to test its security level and configuration using this free tool. 

Google在上周发表声明的时候就已经有很多网站管理员接受了HTTPS，并且他们都在进行该评分测试。 如果你整个网站已经是HTTPS，不用担心，推荐你使用[This free tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)工具来测试安全等级和配置信息。

 If you don’t have an SSL certificate, and are looking to incorporate HTTPS for your site, these are a few basic tips for getting started straight from Google:

- Decide the kind of certificate you need: single, multi-domain, or wildcard certificate – find out more here
- Use 2048-bit key certificates
- Use relative URLs for resources that reside on the same secure domain
- Use protocol relative URLs for all other domains
- Check out Google’s Site move article for more guidelines on how to change your website’s address
- Don’t block your HTTPS site from being crawled using robots.txt
- Allow indexing of your pages by search engines where possible. Avoid the noindex robots meta tag.


I’d also suggest that you take some time to read through this Google help document on the subject, and fire over any queries you have to Google’s John Mueller, who has been actively answering questions about this on Google+

如果你还没有SSL证书，并且想将自己的网站迁移到HTTPS，这里有几个基本的建议：

- 决定使用证书的类型：单个还是多域名，还是通配符式的域名.[详情](https://www.globalsign.co.uk/ssl-information-center/types-of-ssl-certificate.html)
- 使用2048比特的key证书
- 同一个网站的资源尽量使用想对域名
- 对于其他域名的链接，尽量使用相对协议
- 阅读[Site move article](https://www.globalsign.co.uk/ssl-information-center/types-of-ssl-certificate.html)了解更多关于网站迁移的例子。 
- 不要使用robots.txt限制搜索引擎抓取你的HTTPS站点。
- 尽可能的让搜索引擎索引你的网页。 

同时我也建议你去阅读这篇文章： [Google Help Document](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?utm_source=wmx_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tls_en_post) 了解更多详情。 

###What if only part of my site is on HTTPS?
There are plenty of e-commerce sites that only have SSL enabled in their checkout area to secure online payments.  Bearing in mind that the proposed ranking boost will only be applied to the pages that have SSL enabled, you need to ensure the whole site (the whole domain, all URLs and files) is moved over to HTTPS to gain any kind of ranking boost.

对于一些商业网站，只是将订单到安全的支付环节迁移到了HTTPS。提出的评分增长只是在整个网站都迁移到了HTTPS才应用规则。你必须确保整个网站都迁移到了HTTPS才能获取更高的网站评分。 

###Pitfalls of moving to HTTPS
In all honesty, if you switch your site over properly, there will be no downside to moving over to HTTPS.  Many people have previously expressed concerns about the load speeds of HTTPS sites vs. HTTP.  However, Google’s recent work on SPDY has now mostly negated the speed issue.  Google has previously stated (before the SSL boost anouncement) there is no ranking change in a negative way for moving to SSL.  Furthermore, Google has improved Google Webmaster Tools to support HTTPS vs HTTP reporting, and have produced a useful HTTPS everywhere video presentation, which is certainly worth a watch.

迁移到HTTPS的隐患
说实话， 如果你做的足够小心，那么迁移到HTTPS将会毫无坏处。之前有很多人表达了HTTPS和HTTP网站的速度问题。Google 在SPDY方面的工作全面的否决了速度这个问题。 Google在之前就表示（在宣布SSL提升排名之前），迁移到HTTPS完全不会影响评级。而且，Google已经改善了网站管理员工具对HTTPS和HTTP的对比报告，并且发布了一个[HTTPS every video](http://www.seroundtable.com/google-https-18775.html)的视频。

###Should this be my main concern?
In a word, No.  There’s hundreds of other things you could be doing right now that will have a bigger impact on your keyword rankings.  The need to migrate to HTTPS may well become more urgent over time as Google starts to give the signal more weight.  However, it’s highly doubtful that Google will inform us of when exactly the ‘weight’ of this ranking factor will be increased.  For now, I’d suggest that your main focus should be on the creation of good quality content and earning relevant inbound links.  Once you’ve got a handle on those factors, maybe you could then think about migrating your site over to HTTPS.  It seems many experts in the SEO industry are of the same opinion, judging by some of the reactions on Twitter following the announcement.

并不是说你必须做这件事情。你可以找到其他对于评分提升更有效果的因素。
但是由于Google给出信号要增加权重，所以迁移到HTTPS变的更加紧急。但是Google并没有明确的表示何时会提升权重。我目前的建议是：专注提升网站内容质量，获取更多入站流量。在适当的时间点迁移到HTTPS。并且很多SEO方面的专家也很赞同迁移到HTTPS。

###In conclusion
The issue of HTTPS is understandably complex for many, and there’s clearly a lot of information to take on board following Google’s announcement.  Many web based companies and tech savvy business owners will no doubt be quick to implement the switch to HTTPS, however there are a multitude of other things business owners and marketers could be doing right now to gain better rankings for their target keywords. 

The main piece of advice I’d give here is not to rush into a HTTPS migration.  Moving over to HTTPS isn’t without risk, and care should be taken when redirecting traffic from the non-HTTPs to the HTTPs version of your website.  A poorly implemented SSL certificate can often lead to errors displaying for users, whilst improper redirection can also cause issues relating to duplicate content. Therefore, I would strongly suggest seeking the advice of an SEO consultant or an experienced developer if you’re planning on making the switch to HTTPS. To reiterate – this update affects only a small portion of Google’s search results (less than 1% of global queries). Quality, original website content, produced by a trusted author that is widely shared by your target audience will almost certainly provide better results at this moment in time, so please bear this in mind if the thought of moving to SSL is giving you a headache!

总结

虽然说HTTPS对于很多人来说非常的复杂，但是如果按照Google的建议去一步步的实现，思路依然是很清晰的。许多基于网站的公司，教授课程的公司当然毫不犹豫的选择迁移HTTPS，但是仍然有大量基于商业和市场的公司在搜索关键词方面急需得到提升。 我的建议是，不要急于迁移到HTTPS。迁移到HTTPS也是存在很大风险的，特别关注将非HTTPS的站点到HTTPS版本的重定向带来的网络压力。 实现不好的SSL证书会给用户报错，不合适的重定向也会导致资源重复。
因此，如果你计划迁移到HTTPS，我强烈建议咨询SEO顾问或者是有经验的开发工程师。重申一下：这个迁移影响对Google 搜索结果的影响是很小的。 如果迁移到SSL会让你感到很头痛的花，那么请记住质量，网站内容，可靠的作者，被广大的用户群喜爱才会得到更好的结果。
